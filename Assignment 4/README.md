# Assignment 4
2. Federal law requires that hourly employees be paid “time-and-a-half” for work in excess of 40 hours in a week. (Time-and-a-half means 1.5 times the regular hourly rate.) 
	1. Write a program that requests the number of hours a person works in a given week and the person’s hourly wage as input and then displays the person’s gross pay.
3. Write a program that reads in 3 values and prints out the largest. (Assume three different numbers are entered.)
4. Write a program that allows the user to convert a temperature from degrees Centigrade to degrees Fahrenheit or from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Centigrade.  The user enters in a temperature, and then enters either “F” or “C” to indicate the scale of the temperature just entered. 

	Two sample runs follow.  As usual, user input is in bold.

	Enter a temperature: **100**<br>
	Enter the scale (F or C): **C**<br>
	A temperature of 100.0 Celsius equals 212.0 Fahrenheit.

	Enter a temperature: **32**<br>
	Enter the scale (F or C): **F**<br>
	A temperature of 32.0 Fahrenheit equals 0.0 Celsius.
