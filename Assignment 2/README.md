1. Write a program that calculates the net pay for the week for an hourly worker. The program should prompt the user for the number of hours the worker worked that week, and his/her hourly pay rate. Gross Pay is defined as (hourly rate * number of hours worked). Net pay is the gross pay minus all deductions.

	Assume that federal taxes are 25% (of gross pay) and that state taxes are 15% (of gross pay) and that these are the only deductions.

	The program should output the gross pay, the amount deducted for federal taxes, the amount deducted for state taxes, the total amount deducted, and the net pay. A sample interaction follows. (User input is bold.)

	Enter the hours worked: **40**<br>
	Enter the hourly pay: **15**<br>
	Gross Pay: $ 600.0<br>
	Federal Tax Deducted: $ 150.0<br>
	State Tax Deducted: $ 90.0<br>
	Total Deductions: $ 240.0<br>
	Net Pay: $ 360.0

2. Write a program that indicates the change you should receive when making a purchase. Assume youâ€™ve given the cashier $1.00 for an item that costs less than $1.00. The program should ask you the price of your purchase, in cents. (Your entry should therefore be an integer.) The program should first determine and output the change (in cents). It should then determine and output the number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies in your change. Like a human, its answer should be the minimum number of coins possible. (So if your change is 30 cents the program should indicate you receive 1 quarter and 1 nickel, and not, say, six nickels or 30 pennies.) Here are a couple of sample interactions. (User input is bold.)

	How much does the item cost (in cents)? **33**<br>
	You should get 67 cents back.<br>
	Your change is 2 quarter(s), 1 dime(s), 1 nickel(s) and 2 penny/pennies.

	How much does the item cost (in cents)? **55**<br>
	You should get 45 cents back.<br>
	Your change is 1 quarter(s), 2 dime(s), 0 nickel(s) and 0 penny/pennies.
