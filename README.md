# Spring2016_Intro_to_Programming
A collection of assignments I completed for my undergraduate level introduction to programming course

**Course Description**<br>
This is a first course in computer programming for business majors. Students are exposed to algorithms and programming techniques, with a focus on business-oriented problems. After successfully completing this course you should be able to translate a basic problem into a well-designed computer program. The programming language used in this course
is Python.

Programming requires a thoughtful analysis of the problem at hand. Typically you’ll start with what’s given (the input) and be required to design and implement computer code to translate that input into a solution (the output). The skill set needed includes a particular type of critical thinking – one that includes:
* An ability to use logical analysis.
* A good quantitative background.
* Creativity in modeling (possibly complex) problems.
* Attention to details and hidden assumptions.

In this course we’ll start with simple problems and tackle increasingly challenging ones. The idea in this course is to incrementally strengthen and test your skills. Even if you never program again, this training will come in handy.
