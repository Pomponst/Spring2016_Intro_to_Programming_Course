4. The markup of an item is the difference between its selling price and its purchase price. Two other marketing terms are
	
	percentage markup = (markup/purchase price) * 100%

	Write a program that takes as input the purchase price and the selling price of an item, and computes the markup, percentage markup, and the profit margin for the item. Two sample interactions are provided below. User input is bold.
	<pre>
	Enter the purchase price: <b>12.50</b>

	<pre>
	Enter the purchase price: <b>12.50</b>
	Enter the selling price: <b>23</b>
	Markup: $ 10.5
	Percentage Markup:  84.0 %
	Profit Margin:  45.65 %</pre>
